						<p>I grew up in Nanning. Yeah you probably never heard of it. It is the capital of Guangxi
							Province, where the ever famous tourism city, Guilin, is located in. Leaving my hometown
							at 15, I have been living and studying in 5 different cities across the globe and learned
							three more languages than my mother tongues in the process. I am a culture and art
							ethusiast that's why I am never getting bored with interacting with the locals, observing
							their lives and listening to their unique stories. I am firm believer that diversity makes our
						world better hehehe :)</p>
						<br>
						<p>I like the moderity of skycrappers but also adore the antiquity of those hundred-years old
							cathedrals and temples. I live in the US where people value democracy, but I am also
							curious to see what North Korea looks like haha! I look up online for outfit styles of Paris
							models, but I am always waiting for a trip to the old African tribe to see other colorful and
						traditional decorations locals women put on their bodies...</p>
						<br>
						<p>The world is big, I am still young, and I am always dans la rue...</p>
